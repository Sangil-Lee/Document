 Please follow the structure as the other tech notes as

  - Directory name should be
 
    tech_'subject'

    For example, tech_fai, tech_olog, and so on

  - file name should be
  
    tech_'subject'.tex

    For example, tech_fai.tex, tech_log.tex, and so on.


  So we can maintain them easily....
